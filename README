This is my first Node.js project and first time using GitHub. Hopefully I learn something! 

My goal is to create a site with a login and use jQuery. I'm not a web developer so will be very rudimentary. 

I am loosely basing this off of the excellent tutorial I found here: http://www.hacksparrow.com/express-js-tutorial.html

Steps I've taken (will update):

1) Installed node, npm, express.
2) Created express app (express --sessions --css stylus)
3) Created a new view (home.jade) and route (store.js) and updated app.js to use them.
4) Edited home.jade with a basic log-in page
5) Edited style.styl for a background color and other more interesting style
6) Edited app.js to route the log-in post
